> An analysis of the performance of search algorithms solving cargo problems

This is part of the Udacity nanodegree for Artificial Intelligence. The complete assignment can be found in the [README](.README.md) to this repository.

This analysis covers three different problems that are solved with a variety of algorithms.

## Problem Space

All three problems are in the same domain of cargo logistics at airports. The underlying `Action Schema` is the following

```
Action(Load(c, p, a),
	PRECOND: At(c, a) âˆ§ At(p, a) âˆ§ Cargo(c) âˆ§ Plane(p) âˆ§ Airport(a)
	EFFECT: Â¬ At(c, a) âˆ§ In(c, p))
Action(Unload(c, p, a),
	PRECOND: In(c, p) âˆ§ At(p, a) âˆ§ Cargo(c) âˆ§ Plane(p) âˆ§ Airport(a)
	EFFECT: At(c, a) âˆ§ Â¬ In(c, p))
Action(Fly(p, from, to),
	PRECOND: At(p, from) âˆ§ Plane(p) âˆ§ Airport(from) âˆ§ Airport(to)
	EFFECT: Â¬ At(p, from) âˆ§ At(p, to))
```

where the problems are defined as

### Observations

One thing that clearly shows in the comparison table is that algorithms that only run a small number of expansions and therefore cover smaller number of nodes lead to longer paths. This is expected because without a proper heuristic the algorithm would need to cover as much solution space as possible to find the best answer.

Those algorithms that yield the best results have a high number of iterated nodes. Breadth First and Uniform Cost Search seem to perform benchmark when looking at the path length. Depth First seems to deliver the fastest solution but in complex scenarios like Cargo 2 & 3 it delivers a really costly solution. Greedy Best First seems to provide a good tradeoff between solution speed and the cost of the calculated solution.

To my surprise the Depth Limited Search performs really bad in both categories. It takes longer than other algorithms to find a solution and the solution has one of the longest paths.

### Conclusion

With the observations made from this comparison the following conclusions can be made:

1. For scenarios where the search duration needs to be minimized the `Greedy Best First` Algorithm delivers solutions quickly, however not the best solution
2. If the application allows for more time during the search the algorithms `Breadth First` or `Uniform Cost Search` deliver the solution with the lowest cost (shortest path).

## Heuristic Searches (A*)

In this chapter multiple heuristics for the A-Star algorithm will be benchmarked on the three Cargo Problems.

### Observations

Heuristic algorithms take a lot longer to come up with the solution in this problem space. This might be due to the nature of heuristic approaches as they require additional computing time to calculate the heuristic score in each iteration. Although comparing the increase in search duration shows that different heuristics have a different effect. They all find a solution with the same path length though.

Heuristic | Problem1: Multiples of BFS duration (absolute Duration) | Problem2: Multiples of BFS duration (absolute Duration) | Problem3: Multiples of BFS duration (absolute Duration) |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------|
| H1        | 1.6 (0.05 s) | 1.6 (15.9 s) |Â 1.2 (59.8 s) |
| h_ignore_preconditions |  3.3 (0.1 s) | 2.9 (28.1 s) |Â 2.5 (127.0 s) |
| h_pg_levelsum |  46.6 (1.4 s) | 28.8 (281.9 s) |Â 27.3 (1363.3 s) |


### Conclusion

Different heuristics have a big impact on the number of expansions but dominantly on the duration of the planning operation.
The above table however shows that with increasing problem complexity the heuristic approach gets closer to the best time reachd by a non-heuristic algorith (Breadth First Algorithm).

The best heuristic in this case was the H1 followed by Ignore Preconditions. They takae significantly longer than their non-heuristic counterparts in finding an optimal solution though.

## Comparing heuristic and non-heuristic approaches

Heuristic approaches require more computing power to find a solution. However they do not necessarily take more node expansions to reach the goal state. This property is useful in real world scenarios where computing power but the outcome of an action might be unknown unless tested out. In such a scenario the agent would take the costly step in the real world, monitor the result and do the heuristic calculations depending on the outcome.
